Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've made some of the basic blackjack game. Right now I am not using classes or anything but I am considering adding those in since it is getting complicated. So far the game can deal and add cards but there are some bugs. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not started adding the monte carlo or the basic strategy in. At this point I am not sure I am going to finish get everything I hoped to get done, but hopefully I will at least get a full working blackjack game.  

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am having trouble implementing splits into the game, and I am also having some issues with my main game loop. It is not stopping exactly when I want it to stop like there are some instances when I "hit" and it just keeps looping rather than just adding one card so I am trying to figure that out. The splits are the main issue though because I have to figure out how to let a player have 2 hands and let them split multiple times.
