# Other notes about the game:
I couldn't get to every move in the overview so I wanted to also note that the game works for splits, so if you split you will then play with 2 hands and your bet will be doubled. Also, if the player busts, or gets blackjack, the game will stop prompting for moves and will move on to the dealer.

# Difficulties I faced:
The hardest part about this game was getting it to display the right moves and making sure that it stopped once the player / dealer reached blackjack or busted. Another difficulty was getting splits to work, since then the game has to keep track of two separate hands for the player.

# Differences from proposal:
In the proposal, I said that a good result for my game would include calculating a W-L ratio, and a more advanced version would have betting and basic strategy built in. You can see in my progress report and my game that I switched up my priorities a bit after I realized which things were more difficult than others. I started with the betting and the basic strategy and ended up not getting to put the W-L in because I decided to push that to the end, and move the betting and basic strategy to the beginning. I felt that by doing that I ended up with a more interesting and cohesive game then I would've if I did the W-L ratio up front but didn't get to the betting or the basic strategy. So while my outcome is a little dofferent than what I planned, I feel that it is an interestsing and fully working game. 

# What I learned:
The most important thing I learned was the importance of organizing your code in an understandable way. The first time I attempted this I made mistakes and it was impossible to debug because of my organization. The second time around I organized more things into functions and tried to make the code more legible so it would be easier to debug and I feel that I accomplished that.
