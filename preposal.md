# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A blackjack game that runs a monte carlo for your moves, and then runs a monte carlo for the basic strategy move. It would compare them for each move. Then at the end of the game it would give you a score of how well you did compared to basic strategy, so if basic strategy wins 49% of the time and your moves win 47% of the time, your score would be -2 or something like that.

I was also thinking of doing a hangman game where you guess the word and when you get things wrong a turtle draws the hangman until you lose. Maybe I could do the game the other way where you put in a word and the program generates a random letters to guess and sees if it can get it. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't plan on collaborating.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Do you think these ideas are too complicated or not complicated enough?
